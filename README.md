### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**dmrobin/dmrobin** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

Iâ€™m creating a mock-AI system based on the aesthetic of superhero tech.
Iâ€™m learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and how to use Git and GitHub.
Iâ€™m looking for help with... everything I'm learning, really, but GitHub is my weakest area.
Fun fact: I have synesthesia, so I see sounds. Trumpets are orange; violins are usually white.
